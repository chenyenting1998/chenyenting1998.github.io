<p>
My name is Yen-Ting Chen. I am a benthic ecologist intersted in drivers and patterns of benthic life from microbes to megafauna.
I am currently a Ph.D student working on using metagenome collected from hadal trenches to at the Danish Center for Hadal Research (HADAL), University of Southern Denmark (Syddansk Universitet).
I share my thoughts here.

The purpose of my life?
Since a very young age I have always been passionate about ecosystems of technology. So my purpose on earth is
making it possible to advantage of a wide range of technologies and methods and to solve one complex problem after another.
